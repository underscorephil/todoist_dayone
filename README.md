# todoist_dayone
First iteration of a script to log completed [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) tasks to [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/)

## Usage
When no date is present in the config file the current date will be used and
stored in the config as `lastrun`
1. install [jrnl](https://maebert.github.io/jrnl/). It is used to support tags easily from the CLI. If tags are not important and you would rather use Day One CLI just change 'jrnl' to 'dayone'
2. Run the script
