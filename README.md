# todoist_dayone
First iteration of a script to log completed [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) tasks to [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/)

1. install [jrnl](https://maebert.github.io/jrnl/). It is used to support tags easily from the CLI. If tags are not imporntant and you would rather use Day One CLI just change 'jrnl' to 'dayone'
2. Set the date to determine the search period
3. Run the script
